# Pull request templates

- `pull_request_template.md`: The default pull request template. Used for PRs.
- `release.md`: Special template used for releasing a new version of NDSL.
- `release-patch.md`: Special template used for patch releases.

Note: GitHub has limited support for multiple pull request templates. Most notably, templates can only be [selected by an URL query parameter](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/4620) and there's currently [no way to set a title](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/63965).
