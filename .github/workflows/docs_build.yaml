# This workflow builds the docs to catch us when modules are moved/deleted
# and the auto-generated docstrings can't build anymore. This does not catch
# us when new modules are added.

# Run these these whenever ...
on:
  pull_request: # ... a PR is opened / updated
  merge_group: # ... the PR is added to the merge queue

# cancel running jobs if theres a newer push
