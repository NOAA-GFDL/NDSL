name: "Create GHA cache"

# GitHub puts the following restrictions on cache sharing. PRs can access
#
# - caches that were created by the PR / earlier runs of the PR
# - caches that were created on the target branch
#
# To get effective cache sharing between PRs, we create caches on the `develop`
# branch (which is where almost all PRs merge into).
