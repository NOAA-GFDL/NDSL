    "### **Quick GT4Py (Cartesian version) Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "GT4Py is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) in Python that enables a developer to write stencil computations.  Compared to simply running under Python, GT4Py achieves performance when the Python code is transformed and compiled into a lower level language such as C++ and CUDA. This code transformation capability also enables a GT4Py codebase the capability to execute on multiple architectures.  In this notebook, we will cover the basics of creating GT4Py stencils and demonstrate several intricacies of the DSL. Additional information about GT4Py can be found at the [GT4Py site](https://gridtools.github.io/gt4py/latest/index.html).  One small note is that this tutorial covers and uses the Cartesian version of GT4Py and not the unstructured version.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **GT4Py Parallel/Execution Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a 3-dimensional domain, GT4Py considers computations in two parts.  If we assume an `(I,J,K)` coordinate system as a reference, GT4Py separates computations in the Horizontal (`IJ`) spatial plane and Vertical (`K`) spatial dimension.  In the Horizontal spatial plane, computations are implicitly executed in parallel, which also means that there is no assumed calculation order within the plane.  In the Vertical spatial dimension, computations are specified by an iteration policy that will be discussed later through examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another quick note is that the stencil computations are executed sequentially in the order they appear in code.\n",
