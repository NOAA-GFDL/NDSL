# NDSL examples

This folder contains a couple of Jupyter notebooks with the following examples:

- Getting started with GT4Py: [GT4Py basics](./01_gt4py_basics.ipynb)
- Getting started with NDSL middleware: [NDSL basics](./02_NDSL_basics.ipynb)
- Combining stencil and non-stencil code with DaCe: [Orchestration basics](./03_orchestration_basics.ipynb)

## Quickstart

1. Make sure you fulfill the [requirements of NDSL](../../README.md#quickstart), e.g. python version.
2. Create a virtual environment `python -m venv .venv`, and activate it `source .venv/bin/activate`.
3. Install NDSL into your environment `pip install ../../[demos]`.
4. In VSCode, install the Jupyter extension, select your virtual environment as kernel and run the notebooks.
