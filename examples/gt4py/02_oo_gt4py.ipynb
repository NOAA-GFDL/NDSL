    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "After establishing the basics of using GT4Py, we'll take a look at developing an object-oriented coding approach with GT4Py.  Much of the object-oriented work comes from the development of [Pace](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/pace), the implementation of the FV3GFS / SHiELD atmospheric model using GT4Py and [DaCe](https://github.com/spcl/dace).  The `StencilFactory` object will be introduced and demoed."

    "The `StencilFactory` object enables the sharing of stencil properties across multiple stencils as well as \"build and execute\" the stencil.  To help ease the introduction, the [`boilerplate` module](./boilerplate.py) contains a function `get_one_tile_factory` that takes the domain size, halo size, and backend of interest and returns a `StencilFactory` object.  For more details about the objects needed to create the `StencilFactory`, the reader can view the [`get_one_tile_factory`](./boilerplate.py#get_one_tile_factory) function."

    "\n",
    "Using the `StencilFactory` object created earlier, the code will now create a class `CopyField` that takes `copy_field_stencil` and defines the computation domain from the parameters `origin` and `domain` within `__init__`. `origin` indicates the \"starting\" point of the stencil calculation, and `domain` indicates the extent of the stencil calculation in the 3 dimensions.  Note that when creating `stencil_factory`, a 6 by 6 by 1 sized domain surrounded with a halo layer of size 1 was defined (see the initialization of `grid_indexing` at [boilerplate.py](./boilerplate.py#get_one_tile_factory)).  Thus, whenever a `CopyField` object is created, it will perform calcuations within the 6 by 6 by 1 domain (specified by `domain=grid_indexing.domain_compute()`), and the 'origin' will start at the `[0,0,0]` location of the 6 by 6 by 1 grid (specified by `origin=grid_indexing.origin_compute()`)."
