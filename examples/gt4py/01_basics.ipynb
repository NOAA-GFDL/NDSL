    "# **GT4Py Tutorial : Stencil Basics**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show how to create a simple GT4Py stencil that copies data from one variable to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Notebook Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python v3.11.x to v3.12.x\n",
    "- [NOAA/NASA Domain Specific Language Middleware](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/NDSL)\n",

    "### **Quick GT4Py (Cartesian version) Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "GT4Py enables a developer to write code in a Domain Specific Language (DSL) implemented using Python syntax.  Performance is achieved when the GT4Py Python code is translated and compiled into a lower level language such as C++ and CUDA, which enables the codebase to execute on a multitude of architectures.  In this notebook, we will cover the basics of creating GT4Py stencils and demonstrate several intracies of the DSL. Additional information about GT4Py can be found at the [GT4Py site](https://gridtools.github.io/gt4py/latest/index.html).  One small note is that this tutorial covers and uses the Cartesian version of GT4Py and not the unstructured version.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **GT4Py Parallel/Execution Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a 3-dimensional domain, GT4Py considers computations in two parts.  If we assume an `(I,J,K)` coordinate system as a reference, GT4Py separates computations in the Horizontal (`IJ`) spatial plane and Vertical (`K`) spatial interval.  In the Horizontal spatial plane, computations are implicitly executed in parallel, which also means that there is no assumed calculation order within the plane.  In the Vertical spatial interval, comptuations are specified by an iteration policy that will be discussed later through examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another quick note is that the computations are executed sequentially in the order they appear in code.\n",
    "\n",

Let's first define, in GT4Py terms, two arrays of size 5 by 5 by 1 (dimensionally `I` by `J` by `K`).  These arrays are defined using the `gt_storage` allocator, which creates arrays similar to NumPy and provide similar functions like `ones`, `zeros` (as shown below), `full` and `empty`.
