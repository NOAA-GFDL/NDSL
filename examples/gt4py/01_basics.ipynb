    "### Quick GT4Py (Cartesian version) Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "GT4Py enables a developer to write code using a Domain Specific Language (DSL) implemented using Python syntax.  Performance is achieved when the GT4Py Python code is translated and compiled into a lower level language such as C++ and CUDA, enabling the codebase to execute on a multitude of architectures.  In this notebook, we will cover the basics of GT4Py and teach the developer the intracies of the DSL. Additional information about GT4Py can be found at the [GT4Py site](https://gridtools.github.io/gt4py/latest/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### GT4Py Parallel/Execution Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a 3-dimensional domain, GT4Py considers computations in two parts.  If we assume an `(I,J,K)` coordinate system as a reference, GT4Py separates computations in the Horizontal (IJ) spatial plane and Vertical (K) spatial interval.  In the Horizontal spatial plane, computations are implicitly executed in parallel, which also means that there is no assumed order to the calculations within the plane.  In the Vertical spatial interval, comptuations are specified by an iteration policy that will be discussed through examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to note is that the computations are executed sequentially in the order they appear in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Copy Stencil example\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate how to implement a GT4Py stencil, we'll step through an example that copies the values of one array into another array.  First, we import several packages. "

    "As we walk through the example, we'll highlight different terms and such from the imports.  Let's first define, in GT4Py terms, two arrays of size 5 by 5 by 1 (dimensionally `I` by `J` by `K`).  These arrays are defined using the `gt_storage` allocator, which creates arrays similar to NumPy and provide similar routines like `ones`, `zeros`, `full` and `empty`.  The `gt_storage` array will be created using two different functions: `.zeros` and `.from_array`.  There also is a `.from_array` function that lets the user define a `numpy` array whose data can be passed into a `gt_storage` array.\n",
