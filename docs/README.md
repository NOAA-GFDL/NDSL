# NDSL docs

This folder contains the NDSL documentation. For now, it is not automatically published. To build and view documentation locally,

```bash
make html
```

Then point your browser to the local html files in `_build/html` as mentioned in the build output.

Be sure to include the `docs` extras when installing `NDSL`. The extra packages for docs are automatically included in the `develop` flavor.
