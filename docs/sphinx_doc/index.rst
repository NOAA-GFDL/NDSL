NDSL Documentation
==================

NDSL is domain-specific language for scientific computing in Python, it supports most of the Python language semantics, with performance compartible as the native C and C++ programming language.


NDSL has been used as the backend of Pace model (https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/pace), which runs on a laptop using Python-based backend, and on thousands of heterogeneous compute nodes of a large supercomputer using C/C++ and Cuda/HiP backend.
